# tokentrasher.app

tokentrasher.app fills the gap for when users are air-dropped tokens that they don't want to deal with, informing them if it'll be recirculated 👿 or 😈🔥not

not every issuer wallet will be able to black-hole...

either through intentional mechanisms in their distribution or simply not knowing the best avenue to do so.

(You can only do it once!)

the void-imp doesn't like doing this and will affectionately inform the user of this. 👿

don't worry...

we still give him the trustline to burn 😈🔥

the void-imp is very happy when it knows the tokens are burned 🔥😈🔥 and affectionately informs the user as well.burned tokens are those sent to "black-holed" accounts, the void-imp's home 🕳️🔍👀

my pact with the void imp will ensure delight for the user,  😎🤝😈

With @XummWallet and tokentrasher.app you'll never give the imp/me access or not know what you're signing for.

😎🤝📱🤚🔐🔏👿
